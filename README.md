## üéØ Overview
This is a mobile, offline, app that uses Gemma‚Äôs unique capabilities to provide AI help on small devices, no matter where you are. It‚Äôs designed to be a personal emergency buddy, providing critical information and first aid assistance in emergency situations, even when offline or when language is a barrier.

## üö® Problem Statement
Emergencies don‚Äôt only occur when you‚Äôre online or surrounded by people who can help. In situations where you need immediate access to emergency information, like hospital locations, first aid instructions, or emergency contacts, but have no means to connect with anyone, offline AI models can still be helpful. For example, if you‚Äôre in a remote area with no internet access or in a foreign country where language barriers make communication difficult, offline AI models can help you ask questions or seek reassurance about your current situation.
### Key Issues
- **Offline Accessibility**: First aid information is often inaccessible without an internet connection, making it difficult to find hospital locations and contact details offline.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Privacy concerns prevent sharing sensitive information with third-party apps, limiting the ability to upload personal data or images.
- **Language Barriers**: Language barriers can hinder effective communication during emergencies.
