## 🎯 Overview
This is a mobile, offline app first - using gemma's unique capabilities to provide AI help on small devices no matter where you are.
It is designed to be a personal emergency buddy that provides critical information and first aid assistance in emergency situations, even when offline or when language is a barrier.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Emergencies are not only happening when you are online or have lots of people around you who you can ask. 
In situations where you need immediate access to emergency information, such as hospital locations, first aid instructions, or emergency contacts, but have no means to connect with anyone.
Or when you are in a remote area with no internet access, or when you are in a foreign country where language barriers make it difficult to communicate effectively.
### Key Issues
- First aid information is often inaccessible without an internet connection.
- Hospital locations and contact details are not readily available offline.
- Privacy concerns prevent sharing sensitive information with third-party apps, like uploading personal data or images
- Language barriers can hinder effective communication during emergencies.

## 💡 Solution
Explain your approach:
- How does your solution address the problem?
- What makes your approach unique or innovative?
- What is the core value proposition?
